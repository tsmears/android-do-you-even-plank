It's been a while since I set up a fresh machine, hopefully the next person who has to do this setup can figure it out and fill this in.

1. Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
2. ? Download and install the Java 7?8? JDK. I clearly remembering starting out with Java 7, but somehow it looks like I am running Java 8 now and I'm not sure when that happened.
3. ? You might have to tell Android Studio where your SDK is. **File** -> **Project Structure** -> SDK Location. My path looks like `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_65.jdk/Contents/Home`
4. Download the [YouTube Android Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/downloads/) (it's gitignored so you have to go get it yourself)
